# NYC Critical Infrastructure Resilience Group

## Project Description and Mission Statement

The NYC Critical Infrastructure Resilience Group is a subcommittee within the AIA's Disaster Preparedness Task Force. Our mission is to develop open-source guidelines and best practices for engineers to retrofit existing commercial buildings in New York City's floodplains. By creating accessible, technically sound resources, we aim to enhance the resilience of NYC's built environment against flooding and other climate-related hazards.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Define minimum flood elevation requirements for non-residential structures** – Establish clear, code-aligned elevation benchmarks for retrofits.
2. **Catalog cost-effective dry and wet floodproofing methods** – Provide a comprehensive list of proven techniques with cost estimates and implementation guidance.
3. **Outline structural analysis procedures for hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads** – Detail step-by-step methodologies for evaluating flood loads on existing structures.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from engineers, architects, policy experts, and other stakeholders. To contribute:

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** for your proposed changes.
3. **Make your edits** and commit them with clear, descriptive messages.
4. **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.
